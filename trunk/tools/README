This directory contains helper tools for use with Flayer:

* mkf/
  mkf is simple ptrace-based loader.  It takes the same arguments as
  flayer (--alter-branch and --alter-fn) and attempts to perform the
  same behavioral modification directly to the target application.
  This allows for application testing without all the overhead of
  Valgrind/Flayer but with error checking removed.
  Note: All x86 conditional jump instructions probably haven't been handled
        yet.  Please post an issue if you run in to an unhandled one!
